Movem 1.0 Beta
##############

Movem is a TV Show file arranger. It will move your show files to a conventional folder structure with as little input from you as possible. 
When configured to work automatically, it can be used within the flow of an automated Media Center

Some of the main features of Movem:
> Extremely fast processing due to a complete local operation. No reliance on internet services.
> Doesn't process video files only - file extensions are ignored, so your subtitle and info files can be moved as well.
> Smart algorithm that can correctly guess the TV show's name and season from many types of file name formats.
> Can use XBMC to improve the guesswork
> Manual mode allows easy correction of bad guesses
> Guess corrections can be stored to improve future guesses (TBD)
> Auto mode requires no user input at all
> When connected to XBMC, can ignore shows that are not listed in your Database.
> Completely configurable via command line arguments for auto execution
> Ouputs an XML log file for both human and machine readability (TBD)
> AIR technology utilized for cross platform support - Windows, OSX, Linux (TBD - right now Windows only)
> Best of all - 100% Open Source!
