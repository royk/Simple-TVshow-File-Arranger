Simple TVshow File Arrnager (STFA)

The main goal of STFA is to arrange your tv show files under a conventional structure with as little input from you as possible.

Some of the main features of STFA:
> Smart algorithm that can correctly guess the TV show's name and seasons from many types of file names.
> Can use XBMC to improve the guesswork
> Manual mode allows to correct the guess
> Guess corrections are stored to improve future guesses (TBD)
> Auto mode requires no user input at all
> When connected to XBMC, can ignore shows that are not listed in your Database.
> Completely configurable via command line arguments for auto execution (TBD)


Architecture

The UI is separated to Viewer and Presenter, with two way binding instead of a Data module.

The Presenter utilizes classes from the core package that perform decoupled business logic tasks.
